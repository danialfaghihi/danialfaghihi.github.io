## Research highlights
My interests are directed towards mathematical modeling of complex materials and biological systems as well as data-enabled statistical and computational methods for predictive modeling of physical phenomena with quantified uncertainties.
My research areas of expertise are 

* Multiscale and Multiphysics Modeling
* Nonlinear and Nonlocal Theories of Continuum Solid Mechanics
* Reduced Order Modeling of Molecular Systems
* Couple Particle and Continuum Modeling
* Data-Enabled Predictive Science
* Bayesian Model Validation and Uncertainty Quantification
* Science and Engineering Applications: 
* Advanced micro- and nano-manufacturing of engineering materials, 
* Tumor modeling and image derived treatment, 
* Nonlinear and failure processes in structures/materials under extreme conditions, and other complex systems.
